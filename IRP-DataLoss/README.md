## 1. Preparation

<details>
<summary>Expand/Colapse</summary>

- Create and maintain a list of 
    - all domains owned by Company.
        - This can prevent you from taking actions against our own domains
    - all people of can register domains
- Create email template 
    - to notify all employees of ongoing phishing campaing against the organization 
    - to contact hosting companies for domain take down
    - to inform 3rd party to take actions against phishing on there infra (Microsoft, Fedex, Apple, etc.)
- Ensure that:
    - Mail anti-malware/anti-spam/anti-phish solutions are in place.

    - After publication
    - At least once a year
    - Test/Validate: 
        - [Customer's Cards](Customers)
        - Internal Contact and Escalation Paths
- Review threat intelligence for 
    - threats to the organisation, 
    - brands and the sector, 
    - common patterns 
    - newly developing risks and vulnerabilities
- Ensure  appropriate  access  to  any  necessary  documentation  and  information, including out-of-hours access, for the following
    - IR Playbgns to highlight information security risks faced by employees, including: 
    - Phishing attacks and malicious emails;
