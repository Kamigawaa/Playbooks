# Account Compromised Playbook

[[_TOC_]]

## Scope
This Playbook covers the steps to take when accounts are compromised.  
Of course, we also need to remediate the hosts where those accounts were used. 

## 1. Preparation

<details>

- Create and maintain a list of 
    - all domains owned by Company.
        - This can prevent you from taking actions against our own domains
    - all people of can register domains
- Create email templates 
    - to notify all employees of ongoing phishing campaing against the organization 
    - to contact hosting companies for domain(s) take down
    - to inform 3rd party to take actions against phishing on there infra (Microsoft, Fedex, Apple, etc.)
- Ensure that:
    - Mail anti-malware/anti-spam/anti-phish solutions are in place.
    - Users know how to report phish
    - Detection exists for office documents spawning processes
        - PowerShell
        - CMD
        - WMI
        - MSHTA
        - Etc.
- Perform Firedrill to ensure all aspects of the Playbook are working
    - After publication
    - At least once a year
    - Test/Validate: 
        - [Customer's Cards](Customers)
        - Internal Contact and Escalation Paths

    - IR Playbooks
    - Network Architecture Diagram
    - Dataflow
- Identify and obtain the services of a 3rd party Cyber Forensic provider.
